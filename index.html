  <h1>Thasi – The Story of Sukul</h1>

  <p>In the ancient town of Thasi—now known as Siddhipur—the ground tells stories. Here, sukul is not just a woven mat. It is a vessel of memory, prayer, tradition, and pride. Made from straw, but rooted in spirit, sukul has long been part of daily life—hosting rituals, gatherings, rest, and reflection.</p>

  <blockquote>"सुकुल भन्नेबित्तिकै सिद्दिपुर हो, सिद्दिपुर भनेको सुकुल हो।"</blockquote>
  <p class="nepali">("To speak of sukul is to speak of Siddhipur; Siddhipur itself is defined by sukul.")</p>

  <p>This simple craft is deeply woven into the identity of Thasi. Every mat is hand-crafted with care, using age-old techniques passed down through generations. It is more than just a product—it is a silent witness to the rhythms of life, tied to the soil, the homes, and the hearts of the people.</p>

  <p>Even today, the tradition continues—quietly but purposefully. At the Siddhipur Community Learning Center (CLC), community leader Krishna Kumar Maharjan has taken a vital role in preserving this craft. Under his guidance, the CLC is not just a place of learning—it is a space where sukul weaving is taught, practiced, and honored. It connects young learners with old wisdom, supports community livelihoods, and links local craft to cultural buyers who understand its worth.</p>

  <blockquote>"मूल्यको कुरा गर्दा, यदि मानिसले यो शिल्पको महत्व बुझ्न सके, यसको कदर आफैँ बढ्छ।"</blockquote>
  <p class="nepali">("When it comes to value, if people can truly understand this craft, its importance naturally grows.")</p>

  <p>Through each weave, sukul tells a story—not just of straw and hand, but of heritage and belonging. It is Thasi’s soft strength, woven from memory, history, and the quiet determination to carry forward a way of life.</p>
